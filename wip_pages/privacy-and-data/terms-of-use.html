            <p><strong>Last Updated and Effective Date: Jan 2023</strong></p>
            <p>Welcome to Ahura! Ahura is a business-to-business (or "B2B") corporate learning platform that provides employers and educators with software licenses that enable them to personalize the digital learning experiences they deliver. Ahura uses artificial intelligence to accompany learners on their learning journeys by providing personalized guidance on how to improve and speed up their time dedicated to learning.</p>
            <p>Ahura offers its services to both Individual Users (a user who creates an account using a personal email address) and Corporate Users (people whose employer or educator has entered into an agreement with Ahura to use our services). If you are a Corporate User, the agreements between Ahura and your employer, such as your employer’s employee privacy notice, supersede some practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Ahura ("Ahura," "we," or "us") collects, uses, and discloses information about you, both as an individual user and a corporate user. This Privacy Policy applies when you use our product, websites, other online products and services (collectively, our "Services"), contact our customer service team, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us.</p>
            <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>
